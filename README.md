# Object-Tracking
A simple object tracker using OpenCV.
Made to get a better understanding of object tracking in OpenCV.

**I have referred to [this source](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/30/opencv-object-tracking/) for this project.**

## Usage
      Press 's' to select an object and hit 'ENTER'.
      
      
## Note
If you encounter an error along the lines of:
> AttributeError: module 'cv2.cv2' has no attribute 'TrackerCSRT_create' 

install the opencv-contrib-python library using `pip install opencv-contrib-python`.
