Install ' pip3 install opencv-contrib-python' as well to avoid "AttributeError: module 'cv2.cv2' has no attribute 'TrackerCSRT_create'"



I recommend using either CSRT, KCF, or MOSSE for most object tracking applications:

Use CSRT when you need higher object tracking accuracy and can tolerate slower FPS throughput
Use KCF when you need faster FPS throughput but can handle slightly lower object tracking accuracy
Use MOSSE when you need pure speed


When the “s” key is pressed, we’ll “select” an object
